Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words representation, CountVectorizer <br>
Machine Learning: Linear model LogisticRegression for handling sparse data<br>
Regularization, TfidfVectorizer and n-gram are used to significantly improve the model accuracy.<br>

Binary classification: reviews are classified into positive (1) and negative (0) groups. <br>
Being positive is defined by a rating score >= 7, if score <=4 it's negative.<br><br>

**Download the movie review dataset for training and testing:**<br>
50,000 IMDB movie reviews, collected by Andrew Maas from Stanford Univ.<br>
http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/index.html<br>

Both training text and test text are labeled, both are balanced data sets.<br>
25,000 in training data, ~50% positive.<br>
25,000 in test data, ~50% postive.<br><br>
